# A very simple sample with a NodeJS-based script that connects with Mongo db inside a Docker-based container 

## Setup your container with Mongo

Make sure you have Docker and docker-compose that will be using the docker-compose.yml script in this project directory. 

```
docker-compose up 
```

## Install mongoose and run the app 

```
npm install
```

For testing the script use

```
node app.js
```
